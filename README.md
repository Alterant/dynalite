[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mhart/dynalite.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mhart/dynalite)

A mock implementation of Amazon's DynamoDB, focussed on correctness and performance, and built on LevelDB
(well, [@rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg)'s awesome [LevelUP](https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup) to be precise).

Example
-------

All basic actions have now been implemented.

Need to add config settings and allow for different persistence types (LevelDOWN-Hyper, etc).

Will create a TODO list soon for the remaining issues.
